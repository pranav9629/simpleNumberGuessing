1. GUESS ANY INTEGER NUMBER. YOU WIN THIS GAME ONLY WHEN YOUR GUESS IS CORRECT.
2. IF THE GUESSED NUMBER IF WAY AWAY FROM THE ACTUAL NUMBER, THAT MEANS YOU ARE OUT OF RANGE AND A MESSAGE POPS UP: "Sorry, the no. is out of bounds!"
3. IF THE GUESSED NUMBER IS VERY CLOSE, THEN YOU SEE A MESSAGE: "You are close.."
4. IF YOU SEE "Nah! It's a bit far away...", THAT MEANS YOU ARE WITHIN THE RANGE BUT ARE STILL FAR AWAY FROM THE CORRECT ONE.


                                          ********THANK YOU*****
